Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const favoriteCars :string[] = ["BMW", "Audit Q6", "mercedes", "Ferrari"];
console.log("I have traveled in" + " "+ favoriteCars[0]);
console.log("I have traveled in" + " "+ favoriteCars[1]);
console.log("I have traveled in" + " "+ favoriteCars[2]);
console.log("I have traveled in" + " "+ favoriteCars[3]);
