Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

const family:string[]= ["Tehreem", "Ghayoor", "Rabis"];
const invitation:string= "You are invited on Dinner Tonight";
console.log(family[0]+ " "+ invitation);
console.log(family[1]+ " "+ invitation);
console.log(family[2]+ " "+ invitation);
